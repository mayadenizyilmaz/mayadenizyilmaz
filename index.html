                    <h3> Welcome to my personal website! </h3> 
                    <br> <br>
                    <p>
                        My name is Maya Deniz Yilmaz, and I'm thrilled to have you here. I was born and raised in Istanbul, Turkey, a vibrant city where East meets West. 
                        <br> <br>
                        From a very early age, I knew I wanted to seek opportunities for higher education beyond my home country. Driven by this goal, I achieved a remarkable milestone at the age of 13 by ranking in the top 0.03% of over a million students in Turkey in the high school entrance exam. This achievement allowed me to attend Istanbul Erkek Lisesi, an elite German high school.
                        <br> <br>
                        At Istanbul Erkek Lisesi, I received a rigorous scientific education in German, which instilled in me an empirical orientation and a passion for understanding humans, particularly their brains. Following my aspirations, I moved to Zürich at the age of 18 to pursue my studies in psychology at the University of Zürich.
                        <br> <br>
                        Despite facing financial challenges, I advanced in my studies with the invaluable support of scholarships provided by the University of Zürich. Over time, I found myself increasingly captivated by the convergence of neuroscience and psychiatry, acknowledging the significant potential for groundbreaking research to revolutionize our comprehension and treatment of psychiatric disorders.
                        <br> <br>
                        Currently, I am writing my master’s thesis in the Addictive Disorders research group under PD Dr. med. Marcus Herdener at the Psychiatric University Hospital Zürich. My research focuses on investigating real-time fMRI Neurofeedback for training and quantifying individuals’ ability to self-regulate reward activation to have greater control over substance use.
                        <br> <br>
                        Through this website, I aim to provide you with a glimpse into my journey, experiences, and ambitions. Whether you're here to learn more about my academic pursuits or simply to connect, I hope you find something of interest.
                        <br> <br>
                        Thank you for visiting, and please feel free to explore further!

                        As I embark on the journey towards pursuing a Ph.D., I am driven by a passion for exploring and contributing to cutting-edge research in the field of psychology and neuroscience. Here are some of the areas that particularly intrigue me:
                        <br> <br>
                        Neuroimaging Techniques: Utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to elucidate brain function and dysfunction in various psychiatric conditions.
                        <br> <br>
                        Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS): Investigating the therapeutic potential of TMS for treating psychiatric disorders, and exploring its mechanisms of action and effects on brain function.
                        <br> <br>
                        Neurofeedback and Self-Regulation: Exploring the potential of real-time fMRI neurofeedback for enhancing self-regulation and cognitive control, with applications ranging from addiction treatment to mental health interventions.
                        <br> <br>
                        Psychedelic Research and Therapy Development: Exploring the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for treating psychiatric disorders, and investigating their underlying mechanisms of action. Additionally, I am interested in developing and optimizing psychedelic-assisted therapy protocols for mental health conditions.
                        <br> <br>
                        Molecular Psychiatry: Exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying psychiatric disorders, with a focus on identifying biomarkers, genetic factors, and molecular pathways implicated in mental illness.
                        <br> <br>
                        Cognitive Neuroscience: Investigating the neural basis of cognitive processes such as memory, attention, and decision-making, and exploring their implications for understanding human behavior and mental health.
                        <br> <br>
                        These are just a few areas that intrigue me, and I am eager to further explore and contribute to these fields through my doctoral research. I am committed to interdisciplinary collaboration and innovation, aiming to advance our understanding of the human mind and brain while striving to improve mental health outcomes.

                    During my studies, I had the privilege of engaging in various research experiences that broadened my horizons and enriched my understanding of psychology and neuroscience.
                    <br> <br>
                    Internship at the Department of Psychopathology and Clinical Intervention: My first research internship provided me with valuable exposure to the research process. Under the guidance of Dr. Shauna Roehner, I assisted the team with literature search, data entry in SPSS, and participant recruitment for qualitative interviews. Additionally, I served as a member of the organization committee for the "Cultural Clinical Psychology - Young Researchers Network" conference, where I relished the opportunity to plan and execute an academic event.
                    <br> <br>
                    Internship at the Psychiatric University Hospital: At the "Psilocybin & Depression" study, I embarked on a rewarding journey of research and patient interaction. Initially tasked with data entry in REDCap, I later transitioned to assisting with fMRI measurements and engaging directly with study participants. Witnessing the positive impact of interventions on participants solidified my passion for patient-oriented research. Subsequently, I contributed to data analysis using MATLAB and R, examining changes in empathy among depressed patients post-intervention.
                    <br> <br>
                    Research Assistantship with Dr. Susanne Fischer: Since February 2022, I've had the privilege of working closely with Dr. Susanne Fischer, gaining insights into meta-analyses and scientific rigor. Our collaboration has thus far involved extracting data for meta-analyses and evaluating scientific practices. We are currently working on a publication on temperature changes and their effects on depression, anxiety, and mood. Additionally, I've managed social media accounts for multiple studies, participated in team meetings, and expanded my knowledge of ongoing projects.
                    <br> <br>
                    Bachelor's Thesis: For my Bachelor's Thesis, I conducted a literature review on suicidal ideation detection from social media posts using machine learning algorithms. Despite the initial challenge of unfamiliarity with machine learning, I immersed myself in the literature and explored various feature extraction methods and classifiers. This experience deepened my appreciation for scientific writing and introduced me to novel research domains.
                    <br> <br>
                    Master's Thesis: Currently, I am investigating real-time fMRI Neurofeedback for training individuals to self-regulate reward activation and its implications for substance use control. Utilizing data from the pilot study of the "Co-Boost" project at the Psychiatric University Hospital in Zurich, I have gained hands-on experience in rt-fMRI Neurofeedback training and expanded my understanding of addiction neuroscience.
                    <br> <br>
                    Through these diverse experiences, I have honed my research skills, developed a passion for patient-oriented research, and cultivated a strong foundation for my future academic endeavors. I am excited to continue exploring the intersection of psychology and neuroscience in my doctoral studies and beyond.
